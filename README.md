    - The `<main>` tag comprises the main content, featuring a heading, paragraph, and an image.
    - The `<footer>` tag contains copyright information and is styled to remain fixed at the bottom using CSS.

2. **CSS file (`style.css`):**
    - The CSS file is responsible for styling HTML elements to enhance the visual appeal of the website.
    - External styling is applied for better maintainability and separation of concerns.
